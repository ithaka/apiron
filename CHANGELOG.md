and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `pytest.ini` for `pytest` configuration

### Changed
- Update tests to use `pytest`-style `assert`s and fixtures (`unittest.mock` usage is still in place, for now)
- Make `--cov=apiron` the default when running `pytest`
- Make test output terse by default (`-v` when running restores previous behavior; `-vv` gives explicit test list)

### Fixed
- End PyPI server URL with a slash to avoid a redirect, allowing deployment of build artifacts during release

## [2.2.0] - 2019-02-04
### Added
- Automated release artifact deployment via Travis CI's `providers` feature

### Changed
- The `endpoint` module has been split up into a module for each endpoint type, still importable as before

### Fixed
- Added the missing `wheel` dependency to `dev-requirements.txt` for creating a wheel distribution during release

## [2.1.0] - 2019-01-31
### Added
- Added ability to create a `StubEndpoint` for stubs

## [2.0.0] - 2019-01-03
### Removed
- The `check_for_trailing_slash` argument and default behavior has been removed

### Changed
- Service domains and endpoint paths were previously joined per [IETF RCF 1808](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808.html),
  which has surprising edge cases.
  These are now always joined by appending the endpoint path;
  the previous behavior can be achieved with multiple services or endpoints as needed.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-12-03
### Added
- Exposed ability to explicitly set the response encoding
- Expose pass-through `auth` argument to `requests`

### Changed
- Moved all tests to a top-level `tests` package and switched to using the `pytest` runner
- Added missing parameter in docstring for `apiron.client.ServiceCaller.call`
- Removed unused imports from `apiron.client`

## [1.0.0] - 2018-08-01
### Added
- Initial open source release of this package!
- Documentation on use and development of this package
- Code of conduct, contribution guide, and issue templates for contributors
